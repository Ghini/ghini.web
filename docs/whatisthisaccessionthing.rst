the concept “accession”
-------------------------------------------------------------

Too often in the documentation you are reading you encounter the term
"accession" and in no place there's a decent explanation for it, or all
explanations make no sense to you. This short article contains a description
given by a user in the same situation as described, once she grabbed the
concept.

New users not accustomed to the ITF2 nomenclature ask me why do they need
pass through the "accession" screen while all they want is to insert a plant
in the database. And what is this "accession" thing anyway?

Many discussions on the net don't make the concept any clearer.

Our most recent new user gave an example which I'm allowed to share here.

»We got seedlings (one Planting with quantity 5) of Heliconia longa (a plant
Species) from Carla Black (the Source), we named them 2007.0987 (a single
unique Accession number) and we planted them all together at one
Location. Now after several years, Accession 2007.0987 has not one but
several Plantings at different places in our ‘Tanager’ garden, obtained
vegetatively (asexually) from the first 5 plants. Plants obtained by sexual
reproduction come in the database under different Accessions, where our
garden is the Source.«

Anyhow, in Ghini you can add plant and accession within the same action:
simply choose the "intended location" for the accession, and indicate that
you want ghini to immediately add the plant at that location.  By adding the
"accession", Ghini also adds the "plant", using all the accessed plant
material.  Quite obviously, if you intend to split your new accession into
multiple plants at distinct locations, you need to go through all the steps.
