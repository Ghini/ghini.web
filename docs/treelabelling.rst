physical tags and labels
-------------------------------------------------------------

You know what is an accession number, and you want to clearly associate each
plant in your garden to its accession number. You have a limited budget, you
do not want to damage your plants, and you can only hope that kids will not
be tempted to play with your precious labels.

there are basically three different types of labels in a botanic garden.

a primary label is one given to a plant while in the nursery, it describes
the plant and is meant for internal documentation and it might look like
this.

a secondary label is directed for the public and holds information about the
plant as well about the species.

a tertiary label is similar to the primary label, it is meant for adult
individuals on display in the garden, it is generally of aluminium, and it
only identifies the plant with its record in the database.
