User Guide
=============

Here the user finds a small set of relevant articles, all related to
describing a botanical collection, focusing on the two aspects of the
collection: geographic, and botanic.

This User Guide is not intended as a definitive book on any particular
subject, it's just a set of articles. Each article in this User Guide solves
a practical problem, it starts with a description of the initial situation
and an anticipation of the intended result, and it describes the limitations
of the approach taken.
